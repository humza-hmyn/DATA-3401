    "This final exam is simliar to the midterm exam. Please work the exercises below **on your own**.  When you have completed the exam, you should push your completed jupyter notebook to your GitHub repo for this class in the **Exams->Final** folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not discuss the problems with **anyone else**, including persons on an online internet forum. Consulting an outside source like this will be considered an academic integrity violation. **Any questions should be referred to me.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use all class resources including previous labs and lectures, and anything posted on the course GitHub repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may not use any function that trivializes a problem. For example, if I ask you to write a `max` function that computes the maximum entry in a list, you are not allowed to use the pre-defined Python function `max`; you must write your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem below will be worth approximately 25 points, and the Bonus will be worth 10. Achieving over 100 on this exam is possible if the Bonus is completed."

    "1. Open the abalone.names file in your notebook. Using the information there, in a new cell briefly describe the data set and relevant features.\n",
    "1. Load the abalone.data file into a dataframe using pandas. Print the .head() of the dataframe\n",
    "1. Using the .names file, **add** a header line to your dataframe describing each column of data\n",
    "1. Take the last column and make a new dataframe called `labels`\n",
    "    1. Print out the value counts of each label.\n",
    "    1. What do you notice about the distribution of the labels?\n",
    "    1. Based on your observations, propose a way to modify the labels to consolidate some of the classes, and do this modification (you should describe in comments in your code what change you are making)\n",
    "    1. After making your modification, show the value counts of the new labels again\n",
    "1. Make a scatterplot of each feature against the others (it should be a single plot)\n",
    "    1. Describe any trends or correlations that you see.\n",
    "1. As in the Titanic lecture and previous lab, plot 2 stacked histograms of any features you like, color coded by the label. Describe any trends you see."

As before, write a function `random_walk(num_steps,init_position)` that takes an integer for `num_steps` corresponding to how many steps the random walker will take, and a numpy array for `init_position` with x and y coordinates of the starting point. The function should return the full sequence of positions of the walker as they take `num_steps` steps\n",
