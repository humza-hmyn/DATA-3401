    "The purpose of this lab is for you to become more comfortable with numpy syntax and the random commands. At the beginning of this lab notebook, you will need to import numpy and pyplot (a subpackage of matplotlib).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not yet installed numpy or matplotlib, enter the following command in a new Ubuntu terminal (regular terminal for Mac users) `pip3 install numpy matplotlib`  -- If you have a jupyter notebook running already, you will need to close out of your jupyter session after installing these packages and restart a new kernel from the terminal."

Write a function that rolls a dice `n` times for a given integer `n` and computes a *running percentage* of times each number is rolled (# of times 1 has been rolled)/(# of rolls so far) and so on. That is, at the `i`-th roll, you should compute (# of 1s)/i, (# of 2s)/i, ... and store these values.\n",
