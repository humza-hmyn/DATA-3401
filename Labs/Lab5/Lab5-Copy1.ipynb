If you want to do the game an alternate way, I suggest you tell me your idea so that we can discuss it and I will give you feedback.\n",

Players successively place down their pieces at one board square until one player's pieces either fills an entire column, entire row, or the entire diagonal of the board.  If the board is filled and there is no player, then the game is a draw.  For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe.\n"
